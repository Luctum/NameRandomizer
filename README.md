# NameRandomizer - BETA

A little name generator script made using ruby because I was bored

Actually this is just a single file that contains a class "Name" and some function/method.
The script is actually doing well at generating short names. (when I say well it is "legit" names or with easy prononciation !)

Example :
- Uor
- Fidh
- Jodq
- Qiei
- Auquea
- Pourso
- ...

But for long names sometimes generated names are weird

Example : 
- Auiwolvu
- Awqoslij
- Vowlivliww
- Doubuiua
- Cubpiette

Things to do :
- Add some restriction (for example, I don't want to allow some sonority like "VQ", "CD" or "JG"
- Add some Feminine / Male option for the name (like, -enne, -inne/-in, -ie etc)
- Prioritise some letter like T, R rather than X, W etc
- Do a GUI

IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTION DO NOT HESITATE TO CONTACT ME
